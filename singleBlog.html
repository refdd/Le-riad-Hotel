            A museum as well as the palace of Prince Mohamed Ali Manial is a
            magnificent exhibit of Egypt's history. It originated with Alawiyya
            Empire, the period during which Muhammad Ali in its place ruled
            Egypt. It is located in the southern Cairo neighborhood of Manial.
            Palaces and mansions were kept in excellent condition in recent
            decades, keeping their original beauty intact. In this article, we
            will discuss the history of the Manial Palace.

            Building work on the Manial Palace took place between 1899 and 1929
            during the reign of Prince Mohamed Ali (1875-1955), King Farouk's
            uncle. Founder of the Persian Empire, he was the second child and
            grandchild of Khedive Ismail, as well as a brother of Al-Abbas Hilmi
            II. He was born in Cairo, Egypt, on November 9, 1875. With a
            curiosity for learning, he attended Abdeen High School before he
            traveled throughout Europe to graduate from Swiss high school Hyksos
            before he studied at Terzianum School in Austria. After his father
            died in 1892, he decided to study military science. He later headed
            back to Egypt. He was always known to be a smart guy with a passion
            for literature, art, science, and a great amount of knowledge. He
            built such a superb palace that it clearly explains how he did it.

            Prince Mohammed Ali held numerous parties throughout the royal
            period to entertain top pashas, ministers, dignitaries, artists, and
            journalists. After his death, he asked for the Palace to be
            preserved as a museum. In 1952, they seized the assets belonging to
            Muhammad Ali Pasha, and the mansion became a museum, allowing the
            public to view the splendor in which they lived. The Palace in 2020,
            in celebration of 117 years of existence, held a special art
            exhibition in which they put on several of the Palace's most
            distinguished works of art were displayed in the main hall.

            A public art and history museum has been built in the Manial Palace
            that exhibits artwork. It stores a wide range of objects including
            pieces of art, silver, and clothing. Among the items donated by the
            family of Mohamed Ali Pasha were texts, drawings, gems, and
            candlesticks donated in 1955. The Museum is on the south of the
            Vatican and includes fifteen halls spread out between small
            courtyards. During the time when King Farouk was alive, the Hunting
            Museum he owned was open to the public. In 1963, the museum opened
            its doors, consisting of 1180 exhibits, such as preserved
            butterflies and animals collected by Mohamed Ali, Yusef Kamal, and
            Farouk, as well as the skeleton of a horse from the possession
            caravan on its way to the Kaaba.

            Mohammed Ali became well known because he ruled as king three times.
            Shortly after becoming crown prince during the reign of his brother
            Khedive, Britain asked him to leave the country, so he traveled to
            Monterrey, where Sultan Ahmed Fuad I granted permission to return
            home. It was his honor to be appointed as crown prince once again.
            After that, Sultan had a son named Prince Farouk. The Egyptian
            monarch chose him as one of the three guardians of the royal throne
            after the death of Ahmed Fouad II, he attended the Coronation of
            King George VI on behalf of Egypt during that period.
